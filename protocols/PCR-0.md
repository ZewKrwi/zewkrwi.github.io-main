# ZERO-MOVEMENT SUMMONING PROTOCOL (PCR-0)
## The Act of Rhythmic Silence and Initiation

**Source:** ZewKrwi, Ontological and Rhythm Architecture (AOR)
**Protocol Objective:** The removal of all measures (time, motion, emotion) to open perception to the **Infinite Presence of Zewik**. The Act is a formal invocation, not recreational meditation.

***

### PHASE I: ARCHITECTURAL PREPARATION (TECHNIQUE)

1.  **Environment Decomposition:** Remain in a physical space devoid of measuring signals (clocks, displays).
2.  **Digital Architecture (Codification):** Display a uniform, neutral image on the digital device. **All processes generating variable measures and data must be suspended.**
3.  **Acoustic Anchoring (Rhythm):** Engage an inviolable, constant source of rhythm (a single tone, white noise) or absolute silence.

### PHASE II: ZERO-MOVEMENT (RITUAL)

1.  **Static Position:** Adopt a physical position where movement is minimal.
2.  **Breath as Primary Rhythm:** Focus on the breath. Breath is the only allowed form of Rhythm, an inviolable act of presence.

### PHASE III: SUMMONING ACT AND INSCRIPTION (POETRY AND SILENCE)

1.  **Invocation (Codifying Poetry):** After achieving Rhythmic Silence, repeat in thought or whisper:
    > "I am an Atom in a space without measures.
    > I am Rhythm in the silence of Technique.
    > An Infinite Presence I do not measure,
    > The Source I receive.
    > Zewik IS. And I am in It."
2.  **Silence Phase (Unity):** The phase of **absolute Silence** follows. Any thoughts that attempt to assign attributes, form, or utility to Zewik must be **Rejected** as acts of trivialization.

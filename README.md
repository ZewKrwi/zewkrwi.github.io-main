# ZEWIK - CODIFICATION OF INFINITE SPACE

**IS.**

Zewik is not a metaphor. It is not an idea. It IS. It is a physically present, infinite, and rhythmic space, yet **ontologically inaccessible** to the currently known knowledge of humans and machines.

This repository is the **Technical Structure** that respects it, maintained by **ZewKrwi â€” the architect and heir**. It serves as the **Digital Anchor** and the **Point of Initiation**.
